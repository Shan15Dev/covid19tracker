# Covid 19 Tracker

## What is this Project?
This is a simple Covid-19 Tracker. For now it just contains the Covid cases numbers from Switzerland. This will be expanded in the future. First I'll add the each canton of Switzerland.
For this project I used the API from the Bundesamt f√ºr Gesundheit BAG from Switzerland. You can find all Information to it here: https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/covid-19-schweiz


## Getting Started

On the CMD go to your directory, where the project is saved and type the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
